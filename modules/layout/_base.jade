      SVG icons from sprite-inline.svg
      They are inlined in order to make them work,
      when the template is opened directly, without
      web-server

      If you are loading theme files using a webserver,
      you can remove this code and set loadSvgWithAjax: true
      at the beginning of the file.

      Or you can use sprite.svg directly.
      All you need to do is to add "img/sprite.svg" before the icon name
      and connect svg4everybody (https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody) plugin for IE support

      For example:
      <use xlink:href="#icon-area"></use>
      becomes
      <use xlink:href="img/sprite.svg#icon-area"></use>

    <!-- inject:svg -->
    <!-- endinject -->
